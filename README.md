# functional-challenges-public

Challenges used for recruitment that we share publicly

This is a repository used by Planday Product Engineering to create, maintain and build upon out functional challenges used for assessing candidates.

Please upload the Challenges using the below structure. Every Challenges need to be contained within a folder, with the naming convention "Challenge name - Challenge area" e.g "Ferris wheel challenge - Frontend developer".

You need to add a readme to the root of your folder that gives an in depth explanation of how the candidate should complete the challenge. What we expect them to upload/share and if there are any prerequisites they need to be listed as well.
